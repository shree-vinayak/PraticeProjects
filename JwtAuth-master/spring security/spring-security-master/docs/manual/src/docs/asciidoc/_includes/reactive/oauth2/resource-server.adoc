= OAuth2 Resource Server

Spring Security supports protecting endpoints using https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519[JWT]-encoded OAuth 2.0 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750.html[Bearer Tokens].

This is handy in circumstances where an application has federated its authority management out to an https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749[authorization server] (for example, Okta or Ping Identity).
This authorization server can be consulted by Resource Servers to validate authority when serving requests.

[NOTE]
====
A complete working example can be found in {gh-samples-url}/boot/oauth2resourceserver-webflux[*OAuth 2.0 Resource Server WebFlux sample*].
====

== Dependencies

Most Resource Server support is collected into `spring-security-oauth2-resource-server`.
However, the support for decoding and verifying JWTs is in `spring-security-oauth2-jose`, meaning that both are necessary in order to have a working resource server that supports JWT-encoded Bearer Tokens.

[[webflux-oauth2-resource-server-minimal-configuration]]
== Minimal Configuration

When using https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot], configuring an application as a resource server consists of two basic steps.
First, include the needed dependencies and second, indicate the location of the authorization server.

=== Specify the Authorization Server

In a Spring Boot application, to specify which authorization server to use, simply do:

[source,yml]
----
spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      resourceserver:
        jwt:
          issuer-uri: https://idp.example.com
----

Where `https://idp.example.com` is the value contained in the `iss` claim for JWT tokens that the authorization server will issue.
Resource Server will use this property to further self-configure, discover the authorization server's public keys, and subsequently validate incoming JWTs.

[NOTE]
To use the `issuer-uri` property, it must also be true that `https://idp.example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration` is a supported endpoint for the authorization server.
This endpoint is referred to as a https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfig[Provider Configuration] endpoint.

And that's it!

=== Startup Expectations

When this property and these dependencies are used, Resource Server will automatically configure itself to validate JWT-encoded Bearer Tokens.

It achieves this through a deterministic startup process:

1. Hit the Provider Configuration endpoint, `https://the.issuer.location/.well-known/openid-configuration`, processing the response for the `jwks_url` property
2. Configure the validation strategy to query `jwks_url` for valid public keys
3. Configure the validation strategy to validate each JWTs `iss` claim against `https://idp.example.com`.

A consequence of this process is that the authorization server must be up and receiving requests in order for Resource Server to successfully start up.

[NOTE]
If the authorization server is down when Resource Server queries it (given appropriate timeouts), then startup will fail.

=== Runtime Expectations

Once the application is started up, Resource Server will attempt to process any request containing an `Authorization: Bearer` header:

[source,html]
----
GET / HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer some-token-value # Resource Server will process this
----

So long as this scheme is indicated, Resource Server will attempt to process the request according to the Bearer Token specification.

Given a well-formed JWT token, Resource Server will:

1. Validate its signature against a public key obtained from the `jwks_url` endpoint during startup and matched against the JWTs header
2. Validate the JWTs `exp` and `nbf` timestamps and the JWTs `iss` claim, and
3. Map each scope to an authority with the prefix `SCOPE_`.

[NOTE]
As the authorization server makes available new keys, Spring Security will automatically rotate the keys used to validate the JWT tokens.

The resulting `Authentication#getPrincipal`, by default, is a Spring Security `Jwt` object, and `Authentication#getName` maps to the JWT's `sub` property, if one is present.

[[webflux-oauth2-resource-server-jwkseturi]]
=== Specifying the Authorization Server JWK Set Uri Directly

If the authorization server doesn't support the Provider Configuration endpoint, or if Resource Server must be able to start up independently from the authorization server, then `issuer-uri` can be exchanged for `jwk-set-uri`:

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      resourceserver:
        jwt:
          jwk-set-uri: https://idp.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json
----

[NOTE]
The JWK Set uri is not standardized, but can typically be found in the authorization server's documentation

Consequently, Resource Server will not ping the authorization server at startup.
However, it will also no longer validate the `iss` claim in the JWT (since Resource Server no longer knows what the issuer value should be).

[NOTE]
This property can also be supplied directly on the <<webflux-oauth2-resource-server-jwkseturi-dsl,DSL>>.

[[webflux-oauth2-resource-server-sans-boot]]
=== Overriding or Replacing Boot Auto Configuration

There are two `@Bean` s that Spring Boot generates on Resource Server's behalf.

The first is a `SecurityWebFilterChain` that configures the app as a resource server:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
SecurityWebFilterChain springSecurityFilterChain(ServerHttpSecurity http) {
    http
        .authorizeExchange()
            .anyExchange().authenticated()
            .and()
        .oauth2ResourceServer()
            .jwt();
    return http.build();
}
----

If the application doesn't expose a `SecurityWebFilterChain` bean, then Spring Boot will expose the above default one.

Replacing this is as simple as exposing the bean within the application:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
SecurityWebFilterChain springSecurityFilterChain(ServerHttpSecurity http) {
	http
		.authorizeExchange()
			.pathMatchers("/message/**").hasAuthority("SCOPE_message:read")
			.anyExchange().authenticated()
			.and()
		.oauth2ResourceServer()
			.jwt();
	return http.build();
}
----

The above requires the scope of `message:read` for any URL that starts with `/messages/`.

Methods on the `oauth2ResourceServer` DSL will also override or replace auto configuration.

For example, the second `@Bean` Spring Boot creates is a `ReactiveJwtDecoder`, which decodes `String` tokens into validated instances of `Jwt`:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
public ReactiveJwtDecoder jwtDecoder() {
    return ReactiveJwtDecoders.fromOidcIssuerLocation(issuerUri);
}
----

If the application doesn't expose a `ReactiveJwtDecoder` bean, then Spring Boot will expose the above default one.

And its configuration can be overridden using `jwkSetUri()` or replaced using `decoder()`.

[[webflux-oauth2-resource-server-jwkseturi-dsl]]
==== Using `jwkSetUri()`

An authorization server's JWK Set Uri can be configured <<webflux-oauth2-resource-server-jwkseturi,as a configuration property>> or it can be supplied in the DSL:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
SecurityWebFilterChain springSecurityFilterChain(ServerHttpSecurity http) {
    http
        .authorizeExchange()
            .anyExchange().authenticated()
            .and()
        .oauth2ResourceServer()
            .jwt()
                .jwkSetUri("https://idp.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json");
    return http.build();
}
----

Using `jwkSetUri()` takes precedence over any configuration property.

[[webflux-oauth2-resource-server-decoder-dsl]]
==== Using `decoder()`

More powerful than `jwkSetUri()` is `decoder()`, which will completely replace any Boot auto configuration of `JwtDecoder`:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
SecurityWebFilterChain springSecurityFilterChain(ServerHttpSecurity http) {
    http
        .authorizeExchange()
            .anyExchange().authenticated()
            .and()
        .oauth2ResourceServer()
            .jwt()
                .decoder(myCustomDecoder());
    return http.build();
}
----

This is handy when deeper configuration, like <<webflux-oauth2-resource-server-validation,validation>>, is necessary.

[[webflux-oauth2-resource-server-decoder-bean]]
==== Exposing a `ReactiveJwtDecoder` `@Bean`

Or, exposing a `ReactiveJwtDecoder` `@Bean` has the same effect as `decoder()`:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
public JwtDecoder jwtDecoder() {
    return new NimbusReactiveJwtDecoder(jwkSetUri);
}
----

[[webflux-oauth2-resource-server-authorization]]
=== Configuring Authorization

A JWT that is issued from an OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server will typically either have a `scope` or `scp` attribute, indicating the scopes (or authorities) it's been granted, for example:

`{ ..., "scope" : "messages contacts"}`

When this is the case, Resource Server will attempt to coerce these scopes into a list of granted authorities, prefixing each scope with the string "SCOPE_".

This means that to protect an endpoint or method with a scope derived from a JWT, the corresponding expressions should include this prefix:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
SecurityWebFilterChain springSecurityFilterChain(ServerHttpSecurity http) {
    http
        .authorizeExchange()
            .mvcMatchers("/contacts/**").hasAuthority("SCOPE_contacts")
            .mvcMatchers("/messages/**").hasAuthority("SCOPE_messages")
            .anyExchange().authenticated()
            .and()
        .oauth2ResourceServer()
            .jwt();
    return http.build();
}
----

Or similarly with method security:

[source,java]
----
@PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('SCOPE_messages')")
public List<Message> getMessages(...) {}
----

[[webflux-oauth2-resource-server-authorization-extraction]]
==== Extracting Authorities Manually

However, there are a number of circumstances where this default is insufficient.
For example, some authorization servers don't use the `scope` attribute, but instead have their own custom attribute.
Or, at other times, the resource server may need to adapt the attribute or a composition of attributes into internalized authorities.

To this end, the DSL exposes `jwtAuthenticationConverter()`:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
SecurityWebFilterChain springSecurityFilterChain(ServerHttpSecurity http) {
    http
        .authorizeExchange()
            .anyExchange().authenticated()
            .and()
        .oauth2ResourceServer()
            .jwt()
                .jwtAuthenticationConverter(grantedAuthoritiesExtractor());
    return http.build();
}

Converter<Jwt, Mono<AbstractAuthenticationToken>> grantedAuthoritiesExtractor() {
    GrantedAuthoritiesExtractor extractor = new GrantedAuthoritiesExtractor();
    return new ReactiveJwtAuthenticationConverterAdapter(extractor);
}
----

which is responsible for converting a `Jwt` into an `Authentication`.

We can override this quite simply to alter the way granted authorities are derived:

[source,java]
----
static class GrantedAuthoritiesExtractor extends JwtAuthenticationConverter {
    protected Collection<GrantedAuthority> extractAuthorities(Jwt jwt) {
        Collection<String> authorities = (Collection<String>)
                jwt.getClaims().get("mycustomclaim");

        return authorities.stream()
                .map(SimpleGrantedAuthority::new)
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
    }
}
----

For more flexibility, the DSL supports entirely replacing the converter with any class that implements `Converter<Jwt, Mono<AbstractAuthenticationToken>>`:

[source,java]
----
static class CustomAuthenticationConverter implements Converter<Jwt, Mono<AbstractAuthenticationToken>> {
    public AbstractAuthenticationToken convert(Jwt jwt) {
        return Mono.just(jwt).map(this::doConversion);
    }
}
----

[[webflux-oauth2-resource-server-validation]]
=== Configuring Validation

Using <<webflux-oauth2-resource-server-minimal-configuration,minimal Spring Boot configuration>>, indicating the authorization server's issuer uri, Resource Server will default to verifying the `iss` claim as well as the `exp` and `nbf` timestamp claims.

In circumstances where validation needs to be customized, Resource Server ships with two standard validators and also accepts custom `OAuth2TokenValidator` instances.

[[webflux-oauth2-resource-server-validation-clockskew]]
==== Customizing Timestamp Validation

JWT's typically have a window of validity, with the start of the window indicated in the `nbf` claim and the end indicated in the `exp` claim.

However, every server can experience clock drift, which can cause tokens to appear expired to one server, but not to another.
This can cause some implementation heartburn as the number of collaborating servers increases in a distributed system.

Resource Server uses `JwtTimestampValidator` to verify a token's validity window, and it can be configured with a `clockSkew` to alleviate the above problem:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
ReactiveJwtDecoder jwtDecoder() {
     NimbusReactiveJwtDecoder jwtDecoder = (NimbusReactiveJwtDecoder)
             ReactiveJwtDecoders.withOidcIssuerLocation(issuerUri);

     OAuth2TokenValidator<Jwt> withClockSkew = new DelegatingOAuth2TokenValidator<>(
            new JwtTimestampValidator(Duration.ofSeconds(60)),
            new IssuerValidator(issuerUri));

     jwtDecoder.setJwtValidator(withClockSkew);

     return jwtDecoder;
}
----

[NOTE]
By default, Resource Server configures a clock skew of 30 seconds.

[[webflux-oauth2-resource-server-validation-custom]]
==== Configuring a Custom Validator

Adding a check for the `aud` claim is simple with the `OAuth2TokenValidator` API:

[source,java]
----
public class AudienceValidator implements OAuth2TokenValidator<Jwt> {
    OAuth2Error error = new OAuth2Error("invalid_token", "The required audience is missing", null);

    public OAuth2TokenValidatorResult validate(Jwt jwt) {
        if (jwt.getAudience().contains("messaging")) {
            return OAuth2TokenValidatorResult.success();
        } else {
            return OAuth2TokenValidatorResult.failure(error);
        }
    }
}
----

Then, to add into a resource server, it's a matter of specifying the `ReactiveJwtDecoder` instance:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
ReactiveJwtDecoder jwtDecoder() {
    NimbusReactiveJwtDecoder jwtDecoder = (NimbusReactiveJwtDecoder)
            ReactiveJwtDecoders.withOidcIssuerLocation(issuerUri);

    OAuth2TokenValidator<Jwt> audienceValidator = new AudienceValidator();
    OAuth2TokenValidator<Jwt> withIssuer = JwtValidators.createDefaultWithIssuer(issuerUri);
    OAuth2TokenValidator<Jwt> withAudience = new DelegatingOAuth2TokenValidator<>(withIssuer, audienceValidator);

    jwtDecoder.setJwtValidator(withAudience);

    return jwtDecoder;
}
----
